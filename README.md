# SoundgasmDOTnet profile scraper  

A rather elementary profile scraper that will download all the publicly available audio files associated with any one account. This script requires selenium Webdriver specifically the Chrome variant.   
**This script requires editing to function.**   
You are required to manually paste in the link to the profile you wish to scrape.  

### Alternate uses
You may find some accounts do not have their audio publicly-listed but instead list them on forums.  
If you can find a list of non-public links to the audio page then you may simply add them to the "raw.txt" file.

### Requirements  
Python 3.7+  
Chrome selenium Webdriver (installed to the specified location in the script)  
OS agnostic as long as wget is functional.


#### Disclaimer
I do not condone or suggest the use of the script for any reason and this script is for educational purposes only.  
You should always respect the robots.txt of any website.
